### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

 In this lab, we used functions and function parameters to convert measurements.
 This was tricky at first, but now it seems quite easy. We then output the 
 results to the user. In the second part of the lab, we used if and else 
 statements to create a guessing game. This helped me learn how to put if 
 statements inside of if statements. 

* Lab 8

 In this lab, we used a for-each loop to go through vectors to find scores. We 
 made a vector of scores for our competition. The second part, which I enjoyed 
 more, used loops to create an interesting image of repeating symbols. I 
 learned a lot about loops and how they work with vectors in this lab, which is 
 why this lab is my favorite. 

* Lab 11

 In this lab, we looped through a file with every state and created a class for 
 each one. We then found the sparsest and densest state. We created a more 
 advanced guessing game for the second part of the lab. This made this lab my 
 favorite because it built upon our previous project. This time, we used classes 
 to determine the state of our game. We also used random number generators to 
 create a secret number.
